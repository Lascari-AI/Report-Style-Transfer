## Ready to Implement? Start Here
The approach above can be adapted to any domain requiring style matching while handling sensitive information. Here's your implementation roadmap:

### 1. Start With Our Template Prompt

### 2. Follow the Scale-Up ProcessÂ¶
- Begin with 2-3 example reports
- Monitor generated content carefully
- Expand your identifier set based on real needs
- Build validation checks incrementally


*Remember: The power of this approach lies in its simplicity - delivering enterprise-grade results through prompt engineering alone, without complex ML infrastructure.*
